69,find overlapping intervals in various ways,,By far  the most common question asked of two sets of genomic features is whether or not any of the features in the two sets  overlap  with one another  This is known as feature intersection  bedtools intersect allows one to screen for overlaps between two sets of genomic features  Moreover  it allows one to have fine control as to how the intersections are reported  bedtools intersect works with both BED GFF VCF and BAM files as input ,bedtools_intersectbed,"bed,bam,vcf,gff,gff3,bam,bed,gff,gff3,vcf",Intersect intervals,
70,calculate the distribution of relative distances between two files,,By default  bedtools jaccard reports the length of the intersection  the length of the union  minus the intersection   the final Jaccard statistic reflecting the similarity of the two sets  as well as the number of intersections  Whereas the bedtools intersect tool enumerates each an every intersection between two sets of genomic intervals  one often needs a single statistic reflecting the similarity of the two sets based on the intersections between them  The Jaccard statistic is used in set theory to represent the ratio of the intersection of two sets to the union of the two sets  Similarly  Favorov et al  1  reported the use of the Jaccard statistic for genome intervals  specifically  it measures the ratio of the number of intersecting base pairs between two sets to the number of base pairs in the union of the two sets  The bedtools jaccard tool implements this statistic  yet modifies the statistic such that the length of the intersection is subtracted from the length of the union  As a result  the final statistic ranges from 0 0 to 1 0  where 0 0 represents no overlap and 1 0 represent complete overlap ,bedtools_jaccard,"bed,vcf,gff,gff3",JaccardBed,

81,calculate the distribution of relative distances,,Traditional approaches to summarizing the similarity between two sets of genomic intervals are based upon the number or proportion of intersecting intervals  However  such measures are largely blind to spatial correlations between the two sets where  dpesite consistent spacing or proximity  intersections are rare  for example  enhancers and transcription start sites rarely overlap  yet they are much closer to one another than two sets of random intervals   Favorov et al proposed a relative distance metric that describes distribution of relative distances between each interval in one set nd the two closest intervals in another set  see figure above   If there is no spatial correlation between the two sets  one would expect the relative distances to be uniformaly distributed among the relative distances ranging from 0 to 0 5  If  however  the intervals tend to be much closer than expected by chance  the distribution of observed relative distances would be shifted towards low relative distance values  e g   the figure below  ,bedtools_reldistbed,"bed,bam,vcf,gff,gff3,bed,gff,vcf,gff3",ReldistBed,

284,peak predictor,,GeneTrack separately identifies peaks on the forward      W  and reverse      C  strand   The way that GeneTrack works is to replace each tag with a probabilistic distribution of occurrences for that tag at and around its mapped genomic coordinate   The distance decay of the probabilistic distribution is set by adjusting the value of the tool s   Sigma to use when smoothing reads   parameter   GeneTrack then sums the distribution over all mapped tags   This results in a smooth continuous trace that can be globally broadened or tightened by adjusting the sigma value   GeneTrack starts with the highest smoothed peak first  treating each strand separately if indicated by the data  then sets up an exclusion zone  centered over the peak  defined by the value of the   Peak exclusion zone   parameter  see figure    The exclusion zone prevents any secondary peaks from being called on the same strand within that exclusion zone   In rare cases  it may be desirable to set different exclusion zones upstream  more 5   versus downstream  more 3   of the peak 1  Chromosome 2  Script 3  Placeholder  no meaning  4  Start of peak exclusion zone   e 20  5  End of peak exclusion zone 6  Tag sum  not peak height or area under curve  which LionDB provides  7  Strand 8  Placeholder  no meaning  9  Attributes  standard deviation of reads located within exclusion zone    fuzziness of peak,genetrack,"scidx,gff",GeneTrack,

351,genome browser,, JBrowse in Galaxy                    JBrowse in Galaxy offers a highly configurable  workflow compatible alternative to Trackster   Overview           JBrowse is a fast  embeddable genome browser built completely with JavaScript and HTML5   The JBrowse in Galaxy  JiG  tool was written to help build complex JBrowse installations straight from Galaxy  taking advantage of the latest Galaxy features such as dataset collections  sections  and colour pickers  It allows you to build up a JBrowse instance without worrying about how to run the command line tools to format your data  and which options need to be supplied and where  Additionally it comes with many javascript functions to handle colouring of features which would be nearly impossible to write without the assistance of this tool   The JBrowse in Galaxy tool is maintained by  Eric Rasche  mailto esr jig tamu edu      who you can contact if you encounter missing features or bugs   Options          The first option you encounter is the   Fasta Sequence s     This option now accepts multiple fasta files  allowing you to build JBrowse instances that contain data for multiple genomes or chrosomomes  generally known as  landmark features  in gff3 terminology   Up to 30 will be shown from the dropdown selector within JBrowse  this is a known issue     Standalone Instances   are a somewhat in development feature  Currently Galaxy copies the entire JBrowse directory in order to have a complete  downloadable file that contains a ready to go JBrowse instance  This is obviously an anti feature because users don t want a complete copy of JBrowse  6 20Mb  that s duplicated for every JBrowse dataset in their history  and admins don t want useless copies of JBrowse on disk  Unfortunately we have not come up with the perfect solution just yet  but we re working on it  In the meantime  users have been given the option to produce just the   data    directory  For those unfamiliar with JBrowse  the   data    directory contains processed data files  but no way to view them  This feature is additionally implemented for upcoming  Apollo      integration     Genetic Code   is a new feature in v0 4 of JiG   v1 12 0 of JBrowse  which allows users to specify a non standard genetic code  and have JBrowse highlight the correct start and stop codons  If you would like to use a coding table not provided by this list  please let  me  mailto esr jig tamu edu     know so that I may add support for this     Track Groups   represent a set of tracks in a single category  These can be used to let your users understand relationships between large groups of tracks      image   sections png  Annotation Tracks                    Within Track Groups  you have one or more   Annotation Tracks    Each Annotation Track is a groups of datasets which have similar styling  This allows you to rapidly build up JBrowse instances without having to configure tracks individually  A massive improvement over previous versions  For example  if you have five different GFF3 files from various gene callers that you wish to display  you can take advantage of this feature to style all of them similarly   There are a few different types of tracks supported  each with their own set of options   GFF3 BED GBK               These are your standard feature tracks  They usually highlight genes  mRNAs and other features of interest along a genomic region  The underlying tool and this help documentation focus primarily on GFF3 data  and have not been tested extensively with other formats  Automatic min max detection will likely fail under BED and GBK datasets   The data may be of a subclass we call   match match part   data  This consists of top level   match   features  with a child   match part   feature  and is often used in displaying alignments   See  Alignments  section on the  GFF3 specification      for more information   If the data is match match part  you will need to specify the top level match feature name  as it can be one of a few different SO terms  and JiG does not yet have the ability to understand SO terms   Next up is the   Styling Options   section  which lets you control a few properties on how the track is styled  Most of these you will not need to configure and can safely leave on defaults  Occasionally you will want to change what information is shown in the end product      image   styling png  In the above image you can see some black text  and some blue text  The source of the black text is configured with the   style label   option  and the source of the blue text is configured with the   style description   option   Feature Score Scaling   Colouring Options                                            First  you need to choose between ignoring the score attribute of GFF3 files  or using it  If you choose to ignore it  all features will be coloured with a solid colour  If you choose to use it  features will have slightly different colours based on their scores      image   opacity png  If you choose   Ignore score    you may choose between automatically choosing a colour  or manually specifying one  The automatically chosen colours vary along a brewer palette and generally look quite nice with no human intervention required  The manual colour choice is somewhat self explanatory  Clicking on the small coloured square will bring up a colour palette   If you choose   Base on score    you re faced with a dizzying array of options  First is the function to map the colour choices to colour values  JiG comes with a few functions built in such as linear scaling  logarithmic scaling  and blast scaling   The   linear scaling   method says  take these values  and they map directly to a range of output values     Logarithmic scaling   says  please take the log of the score before mapping   and   Blast scaling   is further specialised to handle blast data more nicely  These are convenience functions to help transform the wide array of possible values in the GFF3 score attribute to more meaningful numbers  If you need more comprehensive score scaling  it is recommended that you pre process your GFF3 files somehow   Once you ve selected a scaling method  you can choose to manually specify the minimum and maximum expected values  or you can let JiG determine them for you automatically   Finally  opacity is the only mapping we currently provide  Future iterations will attempt to improve upon this and provide more colour scales  The Opacity option maps the highest scoring features to full opacity  and everything else to lower ones   BAM Pileups              We support BAM files and can automatically generate SNP tracks based on that bam data      image   bam png  This is  strongly discouraged  for high coverage density datasets  Unfortunately there are no other configuration options exposed for bam files  If you find JBrowse options you wish to see exposed  please let  me  mailto esr jig tamu edu     know   BlastXML              image   blast png  JiG now supports both blastn and blastp datasets  JiG internally uses a blastXML to gapped GFF3 tool to convert your blastxml datasets into a format amenable to visualization in JBrowse  This tool is also available separately from the IUC on the toolshed     Minimum Gap Size   reflects how long a gap must be before it becomes a real gap in the processed gff3 file  In the picture above  various sizes of gaps can be seen  If the minimum gap size was set much higher  say 100nt  many of the smaller gaps would disappear  and the features on both sides would be merged into one  longer feature  This setting is inversely proportional to runtime and output file size   Do not set this to a low value for large datasets   By setting this number lower  you will have extremely large outputs and extremely long runtimes  The default was configured based off of the author s experience  but the author only works on small viruses  It is  strongly  recommended that you filter your blast results before display  e g  picking out the top 10 hits or so     Protein blast search   option merely informs underlying tools that they should adjust feature locations by 3x   Styling Options                  Please see the styling options for GFF3 datasets  they are identical   Feature Score Scaling   Coloring Options                                           Please see the score scaling and colouring options for GFF3 datasets  they are identical  Remember to set your score scaling to  blast  method if you do use it   Bigwig XY               image   bigwig png    XYPlot    BigWig tracks can be displayed as a  density  plot which is continuous line which varies in colour  or as an  XYplot   XYplots are preferable for users to visually identify specific features in a bigwig track  however density tracks are more visually compact     Variance Band   is an option available to XYPlots  and can be seen in the third and fourth tracks in the above picture  This overlays a mean line  and 1 and 2 standard deviation areas     Track Scaling   is different from colour scaling  instead it configures how the track behaves inside of JBrowse    Autoscaling globally   means that JBrowse will determine the minimum and maximum for the track  and fix the bounds of the viewport to that  E g  if your track ranges from 1 1000  and the region you re currently zoomed to only goes from 0 50  then the viewport range will still show 1 1000  This is good for global genomic context  However you may wish to consider   autoscaling locally   instead  In the example of a region which varies from 0 50  autoscaling locally would cause the individual track s viewport to re adjust and show just the 0 50 region  If neither of these options are palatable  you may manually hardcode the minimum and maximums for the track to scale to   Colour Options                 BigWig tracks have two colours in JBrowse  a positive and a negative colour   As always you may manually choose a colour  or let JiG choose for you   One of the more interesting options is the   Bicolor pivot    This option allows you to control the point at which JBrowse switches from the positive colour to the negative  In the above graphic  you can see this has been configured to  mean  for the first two  orange and blue  tracks   VCFs SNPs            These tracks do not support any special configuration   Known Issues                  More than 30 landmark features cannot be listed in the manual    selector     Non GFF3 likely has issue with automatically determined min max    scores  Manually specify minimum and maximum score attributes  or do    not use varied colours based on scores to avoid this issue     ATTRIBUTION  ,jbrowse,"fasta,html,gff3",JBrowse,html

metric parameter options are   cscore      checker      combo   and   vratio    Default cscore  The cscore or checkerboard score  1  is a metric that measures species segregation  It is the mean number of checkerboard units per species pair  The checker metric  2  counts the number of species pairs forming a perfect checkerboard  The combo metric  3  is the number of unique species pairs  The vratio or variance ratio  4  is a measure of the species association calculated by the ratio of the variance in total species number to the sum of the variances of the species         1  Stone  L

species or site has an equal change of occurring in the null matrix  Proportional rows or columns means that the proportion of occurrences in rows  columns or both in the original co occurrence matrix are preserved but the totals may differ  Each species or site s chances of occurring are proportional to their occurrence in the original co occurrence matrix  Fixed row or column totals preserves the total number of occurrences in rows  columns or both in the original co occurrence matrix  Sim9 is a special case that is not probabilistic  Since both the row and column totals are preserved the only way to randomize the matrix is with a checkerboard swap  When a checkerboard appears in the matrix the 1s and 0s are swapped to their mirror image to preserve the species and site totals

           Careful readers will note that none of the suggested matrixmodels have equiprobable rows  species   This is because tests of co occurrence are quite sensitive to the frequency of species occurrence  As such  rowtotals should be maintained or at least kept proportional in the null models  Sim9 is well suited to co occurrence matrices that have an  island list  structure  Island lists are often found in classical ecology datasets that contain species with well defined habitat patches and are rarely degenerate  matrices that contain empty rows or columns   Sim2 is well suited for co occurrence matrices that have a  sample list  structure  Sample list structured data are found where species have relatively homogeneous habitats and degenerate matrices are not uncommon  In these matrices species will often occur in only one site  The default values of cscore and sim2 have been selected because the c score is not very sensitive to noise in the data and when used with sim9 or sim2 is not particularly prone to false positives  Sim2 has been chosen because of the prevalence of degenerate matrices  These are just guidelines  however  be sure to select a metric and matrix model that is best suited to the type of data you are analyzing  It should be noted that sim9 cannot be used with vratio because in sim9 both the column and row totals are maintained  hence there will be no variance  Please see  5  for more details on metric null model selection        shared       cooccurrence    v1 26 0  Updated to Mothur 1 33

534,to estimate average coverage and generate Nonpareil curves,, Nonpareil uses the redundancy of the reads in metagenomic datasets to estimate the average coverage and predict the amount of sequences that will be required to achieve  nearly complete coverage    Nonpareil outputs three files and one optional log file     Redundancy summary is a tab delimited file with six columns  The first column indicates the sequencing effort  in number of reads   and the remaining columns indicate the summary of the distribution of redundancy  from the replicates  1 024 by default  at the given sequencing effort  These five columns are  average redundancy  standard deviation  quartile 1  median  quartile 2   and quartile 3    Redundancy values is a tab delimited file with three columns  Similar to the redundancy summary file  it contains information about the redundancy at each sequencing effort  but it provides ALL the results from the replicates  not only the summary at each point  The first column indicates the sequencing effort  as a fraction of the dataset   the second column indicates the ID of the replicate  a number used only to introduce some controlled noise in plots   and the third column indicates the estimated redundancy value    Mates distribution is a raw list with the number of reads in the dataset matching a query read  A set of query reads is randomly drawn by Nonpareil  1 000 by default   and compared against all reads in the dataset  Each line on this file corresponds to a query read  the order is not important   We have seen certain correspondance between these numbers and the distribution of abundances in the community  compared  for example  as rank abundance plots   but this file is provided only for quality control purposes and comparisons with other tools    Log is a verbose log of internal Nonpareil processing  The number to the left  inside squared brackets  indicate the CPU time  in minutes   This file also provide quality assessment of the Nonpareil run  automated consistency evaluation   Ideally  the last line should read  Everything seems correct   Otherwise  it suggests alternative parameters that may improve the estimation   For more details about the tool  please check       ,nonpareil,"fastq,fasta",Nonpareil,"tabular,txt"

657,"marks duplicates, outputs split reads, discordant read pairs and unmapped reads",,   samblaster                Summary           samblaster  is a fast and flexible program for marking duplicates in   read id grouped   paired end SAM files  It can also optionally output discordant read pairs and or split read mappings to separate SAM files  and or unmapped clipped reads to a separate FASTQ file  When marking duplicates   samblaster  will require approximately 20MB of memory per 1M read pairs   Usage        See the  SAM File Format Specification      for details about the SAM alignment format   By default  samblaster marks duplicates with SAM FLAG 0x400  The     removeDups   option will instead remove duplicate alignments from the output file     ALIGNMENT TYPE DEFINITIONS    Below  we will use the following definitions for alignment types  Starting with  samblaster  release 0 1 22  these definitions are affected by the use of the    M   option  By default   samblaster  will use the current definitions of alignment types as specified in the  SAM Specification       Namely  alignments marked with FLAG 0x100 are considered  secondary   while those marked with FLAG 0x800 are considered  supplemental   If the    M   option is specified  alignments marked with either FLAG 0x100 or 0x800 are considered  supplemental   and no alignments are considered  secondary   A  primary  alignment is always one that is neither  secondary  nor  supplemental   Only  primary  and  supplemental  alignments are used to find chimeric  split read  mappings  The    M   flag is used for backward compatibility with older SAM BAM files in which  chimeric  alignments were marked with FLAG 0x100  and should also be used with output from more recent runs of  bwa mem  using its    M   option     DISCORDANT READ PAIR IDENTIFICATION    A   discordant   read pair is one which meets all of the following criteria   1  Both side of the read pair are mapped  neither FLAG 0x4 or 0x8 is    set   2  The  properly paired  FLAG  0x2  is not set  3   Secondary  or  supplemental  alignments are never output as    discordant  although a discordant read pair can have such alignments    associated with them  4  Duplicate read pairs that meet the above criteria will be output as    discordant unless the    e   option is used     UNMAPPED CLIPPED READ IDENTIFICATION    An   unmapped   or   clipped   read is a  primary  alignment that is unaligned over all or part of its length respectively  The lack of a full alignment may be caused by a SV breakpoint that falls within the read  Therefore   samblaster  will optionally output such reads to a FASTQ file for re alignment by a tool  such as  YAHA       geared toward finding split read mappings   samblaster  applies the following strategy to identify and output unmapped clipped reads   1  An   unmapped   read has the  unmapped read  FLAG set  0x4   2  A   clipped   read is a mapped read with a CIGAR string that begins    or ends with at least     minClipSize   unaligned bases  CIGAR code S    and or H   and is not from a read that has one or more  supplemental     alignments  3  In order for  samblaster  to output the entire sequence for clipped    reads  the input SAM file must have soft clipped primary alignments  4   samblaster  will output unmapped clipped reads into a FASTQ file if    QUAL information is available in the input file  and a FASTA file if    not  5  Unmapped clipped reads that are part of a duplicate read pair will be    output unless the    e   option is used      Written by    Greg Faust  gf4ea virginia edu   Ira Hall Lab  University of Virginia         Please cite     Faust  G G  and Hall  I M       SAMBLASTER   fast duplicate marking and structural variant read extraction    Bioinformatics  Sept  2014    30     17   2503 2505          Also see     SAMBLASTER  Supplemental pdf      for additonal discussion and statistics about the duplicates marked by  samblaster  vs   Picard  using the NA12878 sample dataset  Click the preceeding link or download the file from this repository    Written by    Greg Faust  gf4ea virginia edu   Ira Hall Lab  University of Virginia         Please cite     Faust  G G  and Hall  I M       SAMBLASTER   fast duplicate marking and structural variant read extraction    Bioinformatics  Sept  2014    30     17   2503 2505          Also see     SAMBLASTER  Supplemental pdf      for additonal discussion and statistics about the duplicates marked by  samblaster  vs   Picard  using the NA12878 sample dataset  Click the preceeding link or download the file from this repository      ,samblaster,"bam,sam",samblaster,"bam,fastqsanger"

        assign taxonomic labels to sequencing reads
    ",,Kraken is a taxonomic sequence classifier that assigns taxonomic labels to short DNA reads  It does this by examining the k mers within a read and querying a database with those k mers  This database contains a mapping of every k mer in Kraken s genomic library to the lowest common ancestor  LCA  in a taxonomic tree of all genomes that contain that k mer  The set of LCA taxa that correspond to the k mers in a read are then analyzed to create a single taxonomic label for the read  this label can be any of the nodes in the taxonomic tree  Kraken is designed to be rapid  sensitive  and highly precise Each sequence classified by Kraken results in a single line of output  Output lines contain five tab delimited fields  from left to right  they are      1   C   U   one letter code indicating that the sequence was either classified or unclassified      2  The sequence ID  obtained from the FASTA FASTQ header      3  The taxonomy ID Kraken used to label the sequence  this is 0 if the sequence is unclassified      4  The length of the sequence in bp      5  A space delimited list indicating the LCA mapping of each k mer in the sequence  For example   562 13 561 4 A 31 0 1 562 3  would indicate that              a  the first 13 k mers mapped to taxonomy ID  562             b  the next 4 k mers mapped to taxonomy ID  561             c  the next 31 k mers contained an ambiguous nucleotide             d  the next k mer was not in the database             e  the last 3 k mers mapped to taxonomy ID  562              ,kraken,"fasta,fastq",Kraken,tabular
744,filter classification by confidence score,,At present  we have not yet developed a confidence score with a solid probabilistic interpretation for Kraken  However  we have developed a simple scoring scheme that has yielded good results for us  and we ve made that available in the kraken filter script  The approach we use allows a user to specify a threshold score in the  0 1  interval  the   kraken filter   script then will adjust labels up the tree until the label s score  described below  meets or exceeds that threshold  If a label at the root of the taxonomic tree would not have a score exceeding the threshold  the sequence is called unclassified by   kraken filter   ,kraken-filter,tabular,Kraken-filter,tabular

772,remove INFO field annotations,, This command removes INFO fields from a VCF file  i e  removes annotations   Removing INFO fields is usually done because you want to re annotate the VCF file  thus removing old INFO fields in order to add new ones later   SnpEff   SnpSift only add annotations and do not change current ones  So  in order to re annotate a file  you should first remove the old annotations and then re annotate  The reason for this behavior is simply because replacing annotation values is considered a bad practice  Imagine that you have a VCF entry  in your re annotated file having the value  AA 1   How do you know if this is from the old annotations or from the new ones  This confusion often leads to problems in downstream steps of your pipelines  so it s better to avoid the problem by first removing all the previous annotations and then adding the new ones    EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION     rmInfo     ,snpSift_rmInfo,vcf,SnpSift rmInfo,vcf

847,spliced aligner,, Introduction               What is HISAT                   HISAT      is a fast and sensitive spliced alignment program  As part of HISAT  we have developed a new indexing scheme based on the Burrows Wheeler transform   BWT       and the  FM index       called hierarchical indexing  that employs two types of indexes   1  one global FM index representing the whole genome  and  2  many separate local FM indexes for small regions collectively covering the genome  Our hierarchical index for the human genome  about 3 billion bp  includes  48 000 local FM indexes  each representing a genomic region of  64 000bp  As the basis for non gapped alignment  the FM index is extremely fast with a low memory footprint  as demonstrated by  Bowtie       In addition  HISAT provides several alignment strategies specifically designed for mapping different types of RNA seq reads  All these together  HISAT enables extremely fast and sensitive alignment of reads  in particular those spanning two exons or more  As a result  HISAT is much faster  50 times than  TopHat2      with better alignment quality  Although it uses a large number of indexes  the memory requirement of HISAT is still modest  approximately 4 3 GB for human  HISAT uses the  Bowtie2      implementation to handle most of the operations on the FM index  In addition to spliced alignment  HISAT handles reads involving indels and supports a paired end alignment mode  Multiple processors can be used simultaneously to achieve greater alignment speed  HISAT outputs alignments in  SAM      format  enabling interoperation with a large number of other tools  e g   SAMtools        GATK       that use SAM  HISAT is distributed under the  GPLv3 license       and it runs on the command line under Linux  Mac OS X and Windows   Running HISAT                Reporting            The reporting mode governs how many alignments HISAT looks for  and how to report them   In general  when we say that a read has an alignment  we mean that it has a  valid alignment   valid alignments meet or exceed the minimum score threshold      When we say that a read has multiple alignments  we mean that it has multiple alignments that are valid and distinct from one another   Distinct alignments map a read to different places                                                     Two alignments for the same individual read are  distinct  if they map the same read to different places  Specifically  we say that two alignments are distinct if there are no alignment positions where a particular read offset is aligned opposite a particular reference offset in both alignments with the same orientation  E g  if the first alignment is in the forward orientation and aligns the read character at read offset 10 to the reference character at chromosome 3  offset 3 445 245  and the second alignment is also in the forward orientation and also aligns the read character at read offset 10 to the reference character at chromosome 3  offset 3 445 245  they are not distinct alignments   Two alignments for the same pair are distinct if either the mate 1s in the two paired end alignments are distinct or the mate 2s in the two alignments are distinct or both   Default mode  search for one or more alignments  report each                                                               HISAT searches for up to N distinct  primary alignments for each read  where N equals the integer specified with the    k   parameter  Primary alignments mean alignments whose alignment score is equal or higher than any other alignments  It is possible that multiple distinct alignments whave the same score  That is  if    k 2   is specified  HISAT will search for at most 2 distinct alignments  The alignment score for a paired end alignment equals the sum of the alignment scores of the individual mates  Each reported read or pair alignment beyond the first has the SAM  secondary  bit  which equals 256  set in its FLAGS field  See the  SAM specification      for details   HISAT does not  find  alignments in any specific order  so for reads that have more than N distinct  valid alignments  HISAT does not gaurantee that the N alignments reported are the best possible in terms of alignment score  Still  this mode can be effective and fast in situations where the user cares more about whether a read aligns  or aligns a certain number of times  than where exactly it originated   Alignment summmary                     When HISAT finishes running  it prints messages summarizing what happened  These messages are printed to the  standard error    stderr   filehandle  For datasets consisting of unpaired reads  the summary might look like this           20000 reads  of these        20000  100 00   were unpaired  of these          1247  6 24   aligned 0 times         18739  93 69   aligned exactly 1 time         14  0 07   aligned  1 times     93 77  overall alignment rate  For datasets consisting of pairs  the summary might look like this           10000 reads  of these        10000  100 00   were paired  of these          650  6 50   aligned concordantly 0 times
