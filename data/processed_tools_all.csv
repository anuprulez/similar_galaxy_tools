81,calculate the distribution of relative distances,,Traditional approaches to summarizing the similarity between two sets of genomic intervals are based upon the number or proportion of intersecting intervals  However  such measures are largely blind to spatial correlations between the two sets where  dpesite consistent spacing or proximity  intersections are rare  for example  enhancers and transcription start sites rarely overlap  yet they are much closer to one another than two sets of random intervals   Favorov et al proposed a relative distance metric that describes distribution of relative distances between each interval in one set nd the two closest intervals in another set  see figure above   If there is no spatial correlation between the two sets  one would expect the relative distances to be uniformaly distributed among the relative distances ranging from 0 to 0,bedtools_reldistbed,"bed,bam,vcf,gff,gff3,bed,gff,vcf,gff3",ReldistBed,
82,randomly redistrubute intervals in a genome,,bedtools shuffle will randomly permute the genomic locations of a feature file among a genome defined in a genome file  One can also provide an  exclusions  BED GFF VCF file that lists regions where you do not want the permuted features to be placed  For example  one might want to prevent features from being placed in known genome gaps  shuffle is useful as a null basis against which to test the significance of associations of one feature with another,bedtools_shufflebed,"bed,vcf,gff,gff3,bed",ShuffleBed,bed

    ",, Marks removes PCR introduced duplicate molecules based on the molecular tagging technology used in NuGEN products   For SINGLE END reads  duplicates are marked if they fulfill the following criteria  a  start at the same genomic coordinate b  have the same strand orientation c  have the same molecular tag sequence  The read with the highest mapping quality is kept as the non duplicate read   For PAIRED END reads  duplicates are marked if they fulfill the following criteria  a  start at the same genomic coordinate b  have the same template length c  have the same molecular tag sequence,nugen_nudup,"sam,bam,fastq,fastq.gz,fastqsanger,fastqsanger.gz",NuDUP,"bam,txt"

        assign taxonomic labels to sequencing reads
    ",,Kraken is a taxonomic sequence classifier that assigns taxonomic labels to short DNA reads  It does this by examining the k mers within a read and querying a database with those k mers  This database contains a mapping of every k mer in Kraken s genomic library to the lowest common ancestor  LCA  in a taxonomic tree of all genomes that contain that k mer  The set of LCA taxa that correspond to the k mers in a read are then analyzed to create a single taxonomic label for the read  this label can be any of the nodes in the taxonomic tree,kraken,"fasta,fastq",Kraken,tabular
750,filter classification by confidence score,,At present  we have not yet developed a confidence score with a solid probabilistic interpretation for Kraken  However  we have developed a simple scoring scheme that has yielded good results for us  and we ve made that available in the kraken filter script  The approach we use allows a user to specify a threshold score in the  0 1  interval  the   kraken filter   script then will adjust labels up the tree until the label s score  described below  meets or exceeds that threshold  If a label at the root of the taxonomic tree would not have a score exceeding the threshold  the sequence is called unclassified by   kraken filter  ,kraken-filter,tabular,Kraken-filter,tabular
