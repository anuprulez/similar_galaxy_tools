59,"find the closest, potentially non-overlapping interval",,Similar to intersectBed  closestBed searches for overlapping features in A and B  In the event that no feature in B overlaps the current feature in A  closestBed will report the closest  that is  least genomic distance from the start or end of A  feature in B  For example  one might want to find which is the closest gene to a significant GWAS polymorphism  Note that closestBed will report an overlapping feature as the closest that is  it does not restrict to closest non overlapping feature ,bedtools_closestbed,"bed,vcf,gff,gff3,bed,gff,vcf,gff3",ClosestBed,
60,cluster overlapping/nearby intervals,,Similar to merge  cluster report each set of overlapping or  book ended  features in an interval file  In contrast to merge  cluster does not flatten the cluster of intervals into a new meta interval  instead  it assigns an unique cluster ID to each record in each cluster  This is useful for having fine control over how sets of overlapping intervals in a single interval file are combined ,bedtools_clusterbed,"bed,vcf,gff,gff3",ClusterBed,

62,of features in file B on the features in file A (bedtools coverage),, bedtools coverage   computes both the  depth  and  breadth  of coverage of features in file B on the features in file A  For example    bedtools coverage   can compute the coverage of sequence alignments  file B  across 1 kilobase  arbitrary  windows  file A  tiling a genome of interest  One advantage that   bedtools coverage   offers is that it not only  counts  the number of features that overlap an interval in file A  it also computes the fraction of bases in the interval in A that were overlapped by one or more features  Thus    bedtools coverage   also computes the  breadth  of coverage for each interval in A ,bedtools_coveragebed,"bam,bed,gff,gff3,vcf",Compute both the depth and breadth of coverage,bed

67,use intervals to extract sequences from a FASTA file,,bedtools getfasta will extract the sequence defined by the coordinates in a BED interval and create a new FASTA entry in the output file for each extracted sequence  By default  the FASTA header for each extracted sequence will be formatted as follows    chrom   lt start   lt end   ,bedtools_getfastabed,"bed,vcf,gff,gff3,fasta",GetFastaBed,fasta
68,group by common cols and summarize other cols,,Replicate lines in a file based on columns of comma separated values ,bedtools_groupbybed,bed,GroupByBed,
69,find overlapping intervals in various ways,,By far  the most common question asked of two sets of genomic features is whether or not any of the features in the two sets  overlap  with one another  This is known as feature intersection  bedtools intersect allows one to screen for overlaps between two sets of genomic features  Moreover  it allows one to have fine control as to how the intersections are reported  bedtools intersect works with both BED GFF VCF and BAM files as input ,bedtools_intersectbed,"bed,bam,vcf,gff,gff3,bam,bed,gff,gff3,vcf",Intersect intervals,
70,calculate the distribution of relative distances between two files,,By default  bedtools jaccard reports the length of the intersection  the length of the union  minus the intersection   the final Jaccard statistic reflecting the similarity of the two sets  as well as the number of intersections  Whereas the bedtools intersect tool enumerates each an every intersection between two sets of genomic intervals  one often needs a single statistic reflecting the similarity of the two sets based on the intersections between them  The Jaccard statistic is used in set theory to represent the ratio of the intersection of two sets to the union of the two sets  Similarly  Favorov et al  1  reported the use of the Jaccard statistic for genome intervals  specifically  it measures the ratio of the number of intersecting base pairs between two sets to the number of base pairs in the union of the two sets  The bedtools jaccard tool implements this statistic  yet modifies the statistic such that the length of the intersection is subtracted from the length of the union  As a result  the final statistic ranges from 0 0 to 1 0  where 0 0 represents no overlap and 1 0 represent complete overlap ,bedtools_jaccard,"bed,vcf,gff,gff3",JaccardBed,
71,create a HTML page of links to UCSC locations,,Creates an HTML file with links to an instance of the UCSC Genome Browser for all features   intervals in a file  This is useful for cases when one wants to manually inspect through a large set of annotations or features ,bedtools_links,"bed,vcf,gff,gff3",LinksBed,html

74,use intervals to mask sequences from a FASTA file,,bedtools maskfasta masks sequences in a FASTA file based on intervals defined in a feature file  The headers in the input FASTA file must exactly match the chromosome column in the feature file  This may be useful fro creating your own masked genome file based on custom annotations or for masking all but your target regions when aligning sequence data from a targeted capture experiment ,bedtools_maskfastabed,"bed,vcf,gff,gff3,fasta",MaskFastaBed,fasta
75,combine overlapping/nearby intervals into a single interval,,bedtools merge combines overlapping or  book ended  features in an interval file into a single feature which spans all of the combined features ,bedtools_mergebed,"bam,bed,gff,vcf",MergeBED,bed

79,computes the amount of overlap from two intervals,,overlap computes the amount of overlap  in the case of positive values  or distance  in the case of negative values  between feature coordinates occurring on the same input line and reports the result at the end of the same line  In this way  it is a useful method for computing custom overlap scores from the output of other BEDTools ,bedtools_overlapbed,"bed,vcf,gff,gff3",OverlapBed,
80,generate random intervals in a genome,,bedtools random will generate a random set of intervals in BED6 format  One can specify both the number   n  and the size   l  of the intervals that should be generated ,bedtools_randombed,,RandomBed,bed
81,calculate the distribution of relative distances,,Traditional approaches to summarizing the similarity between two sets of genomic intervals are based upon the number or proportion of intersecting intervals  However  such measures are largely blind to spatial correlations between the two sets where  dpesite consistent spacing or proximity  intersections are rare  for example  enhancers and transcription start sites rarely overlap  yet they are much closer to one another than two sets of random intervals   Favorov et al proposed a relative distance metric that describes distribution of relative distances between each interval in one set nd the two closest intervals in another set  see figure above   If there is no spatial correlation between the two sets  one would expect the relative distances to be uniformaly distributed among the relative distances ranging from 0 to 0 5  If  however  the intervals tend to be much closer than expected by chance  the distribution of observed relative distances would be shifted towards low relative distance values  e g   the figure below  ,bedtools_reldistbed,"bed,bam,vcf,gff,gff3,bed,gff,vcf,gff3",ReldistBed,
82,randomly redistrubute intervals in a genome,,bedtools shuffle will randomly permute the genomic locations of a feature file among a genome defined in a genome file  One can also provide an  exclusions  BED GFF VCF file that lists regions where you do not want the permuted features to be placed  For example  one might want to prevent features from being placed in known genome gaps  shuffle is useful as a null basis against which to test the significance of associations of one feature with another ,bedtools_shufflebed,"bed,vcf,gff,gff3,bed",ShuffleBed,bed
83,adjust the size of intervals,,bedtools slop will increase the size of each feature in a feature file by a user defined number of bases  While something like this could be done with an awk   OFS   t  print  1  2  lt slop   3  lt slop     bedtools slop will restrict the resizing to the size of the chromosome  i e  no start  lt  0 and no end   chromosome size  ,bedtools_slopbed,"bed,vcf,gff,gff3",SlopBed,bed

89,find overlapping intervals within a window around an interval,,Similar to bedtools intersect  window searches for overlapping features in A and B  However  window adds a specified number  1000  by default  of base pairs upstream and downstream of each feature in A  In effect  this allows features in B that are  near  features in A to be detected ,bedtools_windowbed,"bed,bam,vcf,gff,gff3,bed,gff,vcf,gff3",WindowBed,
